            <p> This week we moved onto writing .json files to create graphs where the data is hosted on our Github. We looked to improve
                on a graph taken from a FT article, to make the data story more robust. The 'riskiest' year in the first graph appears
                to be 2022 in the first graph, but when adjusted as a percentge of global GDP, we see that in 1984 there is a greater 
                outstanding credit to GDP ratio.</p>

            <p> This week we were introduced to data scraping. This <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iDiQsrd5qvnbZraOOliIO4DhfdhWLvuH?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Colab</a> notebook shows how I scaped the data from a table on 
                Wikipedia and then cleaned the data into a TIDY format. From this format I exported the data as .json and used this directly in vega-lite to create the graphs.
                The data was scraped from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Climate_Fund" target="_blank">here</a>, which gets its data from the <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/about/resource-mobilisation" target="_blank">Green Climate Fund website</a>.</p>

            <p>This week we attended talks at the Festival of Economics. We were tasked with creating 2 graphs which support/oppose 
                an idea presented at a talk we attended. In the 'Big Data' talk, Arthur Turrell (Dep. Director at ONS Data Science Campus) said
                that in the recent inflation crisis, prices of low cost goods were increasing faster than general prices. All the data used here
                was taken from ONS supermarket website scraping. My <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a3YLgBiUQ1Vqkm6dgizryIYfrEpy0bc8?usp=sharing">Google Colab</a> notebook shows
                how i converted this data into TIDY format.

                <br> the model on 135 countries, and then test the model on
                <br> the remaining 45 countries.
                <br>
                <br> Since the model was 71% accurate it shows that environmental
                <br> performance is not entirely indicative of continent. 
                <br> So we have significant environmental performance variation
