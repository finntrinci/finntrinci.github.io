              <p>As part of a data science course in late 2022, I created a range of data visualisations in weekly independent tasks. 
                These were each designed to put the given week's skill into practise. The skills include: embedding charts in HTML, alternative graph encodings, web scraping, using APIs to create dashboards, choropleth maps, and machine learning. </p>

              <p>For my undergraduate applied dissertation, I first outlined a model from Alessina and Rodrik (1994) relating wealth inequality and economic growth. 
                Then, after a literature review, I estimated a dynamic model of the relationship between GDP per capita growth and wealth inequality. For this project,
                I created a dataset of 10 development indicators for 137 countries between 1995-2020 using Python for dataset merging. I then completed my statistical analysis in
               Stata (17). As part of the statistical analysis, I employed pooled OLS, Random Effects, and Fixed effects models, as well as a system GMM estimator.<br> <br>

              <p>As part of a group project, we wrote a hypothetical reserarch grant proposal to alleviate a problem faced in developing countries. Our team focused on the problem of infant darrhoeal burden
                In rural Gambia, proposing a material intervention in the form of a household play-space to limit the ground-to-mouth pathogen transmission pathway. Our proposed research project would push
                the knowledge frontier forwards in the development economics literatue, which I justified in the academic relevance section. The project was designed as a cost-effectiveness evaluation to justify 
                donor investment in this intervention. My main role in this project was writing the acacdemic relevance section and a brief outline of our econometric strategy. But, considering the group nature of the project, all members contributed to each
                section as a result of our collaborative and engaging work environment.

              <p>In late 2022, I completed a data science project to investigate the relationship between climate change-related natural disasters (tropical cyclones, droughts etc.) and a country's environmental performance. 
                This project required me to use a range of statistical techniques and coding languages. I used Python for scraping and cleaning data, merging large multi-country datasets, and employing machine learning techniques 
                like K-Means clustering. In particular, (where possible) my data were taken from APIs, so that my Python scripts could be re-run to obtain updated datasets. With the resultant data, which I hosted on my public GitHub page, 
                I created a range of interactive data visualizations in Vega-lite to communicate the data story. This project helped me develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as an ability to work with and merge large, 
                complex datasets.</p>

              <p>This Op-Ed is written for a non-specialist, general audience. The article argues that targeting GDP is not a good measure of genuine progress. 
                In writing this opinion piece, I had to consciously consider my use of language - not just using non-technical terms, but explaining some economics behind the issue
                in an intuitive way.</p>

              <p>As part of a "Communicating Economics" module, I needed to use the 'Long Run Prices Database' (LRPD) from <a href="https://richarddavies.io/research/prices">Richard Davies</a> 
                to tell a data story within 150 words. This is a dataset of over 42 million price observations in the UK, so finding the data story was the main challenge. In my infographic, i relate
                the increase in price of the luxury moisturiser market to the social media 'skincare revolution'.</p>
