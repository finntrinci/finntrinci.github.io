        <h2>Do Natural Disasters Affect a Country's Environmental Performance?</h2>
        <h3>A Data Science Project</h3>
        <article>
          <hr>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>The IPCC <a href=https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15>1.5 degree report</a> says human induced climate change has already increased the frequency and intensity of
             heatwaves, droughts, heavy precipitation events, and tropical cyclones. <a href = https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/sigma-research/sigma-2022-01.html>Swiss Re</a> estimates that global losses from natural
              disasters reached $270 billion in 2021, with losses from floods specifically growing at a faster rate than global GDP. While 
              policymakers at local and national levels can use adaptation strategies like flood protection to avoid some of these costs, “at 
              the international level, the key natural disaster issue is climate change” (Botzen et. al., 2019, pp. 182). 

              <br>
              <br>

            This project seeks to determine the presence of a relationship between climate-change-related natural disaster (CCND)
             frequency and the environmental performance of countries. Intuitively, we should see that countries with higher CCND
              incidence decrease their contributions to anthropogenic climate change to reduce their associated long-run costs.

          <h3>Data Sources</h3>
            <p>The natural disaster data is from the <a href =https://reliefweb.int/disasters>ReliefWeb API</a>: an API targeted towards relief workers, showing natural disaster type,
               date, and location. This presents an immediate bias in my analysis since the data under-represents richer countries who are
                more prepared for the consequences of disasters. However, since disaster reports on this API represent a ‘need for aid’, 
                the disaster frequency is a better proxy for disaster cost than using every global disaster. The latter includes smaller 
                events, not associated with significant costs. Furthermore, since this data is live, it allows for updates to the database
                through running a <a href =https://colab.research.google.com/drive/130b8-G3AKvbTMYnrKPHtCnDFZGudpsfB?usp=sharing>Python script</a>. Figure 1 shows the quantity of disasters for the 180 countries considered in my analysis. As seen in the line
                graph, there has been a general upward trend in global CCND frequency.</p>

            <p>My environmental data is from the <a href=https://epi.yale.edu>Environmental Performance Index</a> (EPI). This dataset contains reliable data on a range of 
              environmental performance indicators for 180 countries. This project focuses on 11 indicators measuring climate change 
              mitigation, mainly covering greenhouse gas levels and growth rates. The strength of this dataset is the large quantity of 
              countries covered as well as the consistent scoring structure – each indicator is scored from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) which 
              takes well to machine learning techniques. However, since the EPI indicator coverage changes every year, the 2022 EPI only 
              has data for 2022 and 2012 (to show a 10-year difference).</p>

            <h3>Challenges in Data Cleaning & Analysis</h3>
            <p>The ReliefWeb API shows event-level data which can include single countries/disaster types or an array of countries/types 
              for each event, with a limit of 1000 events per API call. My <a href=https://colab.research.google.com/drive/130b8-G3AKvbTMYnrKPHtCnDFZGudpsfB?usp=sharing>Colab Workbook</a>  shows how I iterated over a set of hand-edited 
              links to retrieve all available data, then split the rows with arrays of countries/types into a separate row for each country and 
              type to accurately show the incidence of disasters in each country. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Throughout the data cleaning process, country and continent names caused issues. The ReliefWeb API only shows country
               names (in one format) so using <a href = https://colab.research.google.com/drive/130b8-G3AKvbTMYnrKPHtCnDFZGudpsfB?usp=sharing>Python</a>, I needed to assign each country its ISO-numeric code so that this dataset could be 
               merged with the EPI data.  
               <br>
               <br>
               The lack of variation in disasters per country is shown in Figure 2, where most countries experience less than 10 of each 
               disaster type between 1990-2022. Therefore, conducting a country-level comparison is inappropriate due to insufficient 
               variation in CCND frequency. To overcome this, I have used <a href=https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11FRPws0JgXr-oHkosYKfknfSDddCysql?usp=sharing>K-means clustering</a> based on 11 environmental performance 
               indicators to create 6 country clusters. Figure 3 shows the result of this clustering compared to grouping by continent - 
               the environmental indicators are expressed in 2 dimensions where a higher score shows better environmental performance for 
               each axis. Since the silhouette score from the K-means clustering is 47 times higher than the continent case, K-means 
               creates more distinct groups.

             <p>Figure 4 shows the distributions of natural disasters per cluster. Cluster 3 has the lowest frequency of natural disasters, with 
              each country only having one or 2 CCNDs per year while cluster 2 has the greatest variation in CCNDs per year as shown by 
              its long tail. Comparing these results with Figure 3, we see that the 2 worst-performing clusters (environmentally) are 1 and 2 
              which also experience the most CCNDs.</p>

            <p> 
              In Figure 5 we compare the change in our environmental indicators between 2012 and 2022 with the quantity of CCNDs 
              experienced between 2007-2022. 2007 is the initial cut-off because the economic impact of CCNDs last multiple years, in the 
              case of hurricane Katrina, local GDP fell for 5-years following the event (Qiang et. al. 2020). The only cluster which saw a drop 
              in their environmental indicators (2) also saw the greatest quantity of CCNDs, with each CCND type showing a general 
              downward trend with increasing environmental score.

              <br>
              <br>

              Overall, our hypothesis is not supported by the data, CCND frequency appears to be negatively correlated with environmental performance. An alternative approach is to study how CCNDs affect 
              environmentalism, using a similar methodology to Bentzen (2019), where World Value Survey data is analysed before and 
              after the events.
